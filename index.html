        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <h2>Hi, I'm David Mizser, and this is my portfolio</h2>
        <p>This portfolio will feature a few leaflets to showcase key design principles within media, as well as principles in typography, web development and an overall retrospective view on my work.</p>
    </div>

<!--This is for introducing CARP, as well as a few other things. This is not yet a page for schoolwork-->
    <div id="CARP-context">
        <div class="left">
            <h1>Firstly, True/False Film Fest and CARP (Contrast, Alignment, Repetition, and Proximity)</h1>
            <p>True/False Film Fest is a festival dedicated to showcasing fictional films, music, and other vital forms of art that people can share within the community. Bearing that in mind, I have used CARP, the design principle that follows 4 seperate ideas of alignment in text. Contrast, alignment, repetition, and proximity. These are all ideas that are used to create media, and make it aesthetically pleasing, as well as structually logical, and unique.</p>

    <!--Introduces the first piece of exam content. It will include a photo of the CARP leaflets as well as some comments on why it is what it is, and the choices that came to be-->
    <div id=CARP-content>
        <div class="image-box">
            <img src="Images/CARP-Contrast.png" alt="carp1">
            <h1>Contrast</h1>   
            <p>This image uses the design principle of contrast. Contrast is when 2 things are strikingly different, often juxtaposing somethign else directly related. This is often used in Media to make content look distuingishable, highlighting elements in a piece of media, or adding a unique flair to the media. </p> 
        </div>
       
        <div class="image-box">
            <img src="Images/CARP-Alignment.png" alt="carp2">
            <h1>Alignment</h1>
            <p>This image is an example of Alignment. Alignment is when text and elements of media are aligned according to an axis. My leaflet does this simply by aligning everything onto the vertical centre axis, from the logo to all the key details.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="image-box">
            <img src="Images/CARP-Repetition.png" alt="carp3">
            <h1>Repetition</h1>
            <p>This is an example of repetition. Repetition, as it's name would suggest is the principle of using repetition to convey a message, establish a style, or to just make people remember your name or slogan, as I have done.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="image-box">
            <img src="Images/CARP-Proximity.png" alt="carp4">
            <h1>Proximity</h1>
            <p>This is an example of proximity. Proximity makes great use of forcing every element of a piece of media close together, but in a neat and organised fashion. This makes the media piece look busier, but also follow a logical and precise order that is easy to follow.</p>
        </div>
    </div>


<!--This is similar to the CARP page but for the typography work.-->
    <div id="Typography">
        <h1>Axial Typography</h1>
        <img src="Images/axial-typography.png">
        <p>Axial Typography, as the name suggests works on both horizontal and vertical axis. It is based on straight lines and such, creating a neat but sometimes chaotic web of lines on which the text sits.</p>
        <h1>Bilateral Typography</h1>
        <img src="Images/bilateral-typography.png">
        <p>Bilateral typography is similar to axial in that they both tend to pivot around a vertical or horizontal axis. Bilateral is very organised as sit is usually parallel to anything it might contrast with.</p>
        <h1>Dilatational Typography</h1>
        <img src="Images/dilatational-typography.png">
        <p>Dilatational Typography is based on the typography extending from an inner point, or wrapping around an existing circular object. These typefaces have little useful application as the text becomes quite unreadable due to the warping, however they prodivde a unique visual flair.</p>
        <h1>Grid Typography</h1>
        <img src="Images/grid-typography.png">
        <p>Grid typographies, are one of the more useful types of typography. They are based on grids, squares that are split up on a page, filled with content. It is good for modern day aesthetics, as well as clean cohesive layouts.</p>
        <h1>Modular Typography</h1>
        <img src="Images/modular-typography.png">
        <p>Modular typography is similar to grid typography, but even more extreme. Modular typography works stricly in squares. It can be adapted to any format, as the lenghts of the squares can be anything, which makes it good for laying out text. It is one of the more popular and used typefaces.</p>
        <h1>Radial Typeography</h1>
        <img src="Images/radial-typography.png">
        <p>Radial typography works in circles. Somewhat similar to dilatational, it serves to utilise the shape of a circle. However for Radial typography, the text tends to rest on beams extruding from the circle. This provides a unique visual typeface that is also still very readable. </p>
        <h1>Random Typography</h1>
        <img src="Images/random-typography.png">
        <p>Random typography, is as the name suggests, very random. It does not follow any set rules or have any distinct styles. This makes it very free and full of potential to create something truly visually unique.</p>
        <h1>Transitional Typography</h1>
        <img src="Images/transitional-typography.png">
        <p>Radial typogrpahy works like the ocean, in waves. This is one of the more confusing and less useful typefaces, as the lack of rules and regulations of it, as well as coherence makes it quite useless when trying to deliver a message.</p>
    </div>


    <div id="Web-development">
        <div class="image-box">
            <h2>HTML</h2>
            <p>Creating the HTML code was the simplest part of designing the website as it was simply laying out the foundations of the website, its general layout, and how much content I would include. A lot of this was organized using DIV classes, a general layout of headers and paragraphs. This allowed me to create the website you are looking at now, as well as include images using the IMG function to show my work, and with paragraphs, I expanded, provided context, and detailed explanations.</p>

        <div class="image-box, image-box2">
            <h2>CSS</h2>
            <p>CSS is the most difficult part of creating a website. Using flexboxes proved to be a very complicated endeavor. I have used several modes of content to teach myself as much as I could learn about CSS, such as the University's content provided in the module, YouTube guides and videos, and asking AI about specific functions (such as asking the AI how flexboxes really work). Another great source of information was the <a href="https://yoksel.github.io/flex-cheatsheet/" target="_blank">Flexbox Cheatsheet</a>, which was super helpful in managing the organization of my website.</p>

<!--This is for the conclusion of the coursework. This will be a simple page with a reflection essay on all of my work, as well as a few other references, and a few links to things such as github and sources.-->
    <div id="conclusion">
        <h1>This is it</h1>
        <h2>Refletion of Work:</h2>
        <p>Creating the work for this portfolio was a long and complicated process. I have had to create several modes of media, using several new modes of tools that I am yet to fully familiarise myself with. I was tasked with the following:<p>
            <li>
                <h3>4x CARP Leaflets</h3>
                <h3>A typography sheet that includes several styles of typograpghy</h3>
                <h3>The creation of a whole new website that is layed out and created to look professional.</h3>
            </li>
        <p>All of these tasks proved challenging as it is something I had not done before. Creating the website was especially difficult as I have personally struggled with the concept of coding and lacked motivation to learn programming languages, let alone learing two. Despite this, I used many sources to learn more and more and tried to create a website that looks professional. This was a long learning curve, as well as a lot of frustrating moments, such as the website never fully fitting within my monitor, or making small grammatical errors, and other small niggles that showed up during the process. Creating the CARP leaflets was a lot easier. They followed 4 simple yet crucial steps in media design, which were; Contrast, Alignment, Repetiton, and Proximity. I tried to follow these in a minimalistic manner, and my posters aim to be simple and of few words to keep the poster uncomplicated. In retrospect the leaflets serve more to showcase design principles than actuallty promote an event. The typography tasks, researching of and creating leaflets proved to be quite challengging. This is due to the lack of true information about typography, and many forms of it lacking real definition on the internet. Alongside this, some of the types of typography proved to be very limiting in terms of content and usability, such as the transitional typeface, which proved to be a confusing mess and not very good at conveying messages, or giving much creative freedom. Lastly, coding a website proved to be quiet challenging as well. Altough the design ins't as I'd have liked, I still believe that my website has some aesthetic potential with modificaton from someone more expeirenmced. Coding with HTML was simple and intuitive as the language is simple to understand and utilise, however learning CSS was a lot more difficult, often times proving to be confusing and difficult to use, and took a lot longer to become familiar with and learn it. </p>
